  "\n5.Repeat"

      "\nMuscular Endurance Training Drill #5: Pull-ups"
  "\nPull-ups are so hard because they require you to lift your entire body up with just your arms and shoulder muscles. If you don’t already have significant strength here, this can be quite a challenge."
  "\nBecause a pull-up uses so many muscles, you need to have the holistic upper-body strength to perform them."
  "\nPull-ups also require correct form and technique to get right — ensuring you’re activating the right muscles at the right time will make performing the movement easier and ensure you’re doing it correctly. But don’t be discouraged — there are many ways to progress to a pull-up (we talk about pull-up progressions later in this article), no matter the strength level you’re starting from."
     "\nHow to do a proper pull-up with perfect form"
  "\nNow, let’s get to the fun part - how to correctly perform a pull-up! There are a few tips and tricks that make doing a pull-up easier and make sure you reap the full benefits of this powerful exercise."
      "\nHere’s how to do a pull-up with the correct technique:"
  "\n1.Start by standing directly below a pull-up bar. Place your hands in an overhand grip (palms facing away from your body) with your hands slightly further than shoulder-width apart. If you can’t reach the bar from standing on the floor, you can place a box beneath you and stand on that. Once your hands are holding onto the bar, you’re in your starting position."
  "\n2.Inhale, then exhale. Lift your feet up from the floor or box so that you’re hanging from the bar, and engage your core by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Pull your shoulders back and down."
  "\n3.Engaging the muscles in your arms and back, bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the bar until your chin is over the bar. You can imagine bringing your elbows toward your hips if that makes the movement easier. As you move, avoid swinging your legs around or shrugging your shoulders up. You want to make sure your shoulder blades remain back and down throughout the exercise."
  "\n4.At the top of the movement, inhale. Then extend your elbows and lower your body back down to the starting position."

      "\nMuscular Endurance Training Drill #6: Burpees"
  "\nBurpees are a calisthenics exercise. This means they use your body weight for resistance. With burpees, the focus is on a full-body calisthenics workout that aims to build muscle strength and endurance in both your lower and upper body."
  "\nA standard burpee exercise works to strengthen the muscles in your legs, hips, buttocks, abdomen, arms, chest, and shoulders."
  "\nHow to do a burpee with correct form"
  "\n1.Start in a squat position with your knees bent, back straight, and your feet about shoulder-width apart."
  "\n2.Lower your hands to the floor in front of you so they’re just inside your feet."
  "\n3.With your weight on your hands, kick your feet back so you’re on your hands and toes, and in a pushup position."
  "\n4.Keeping your body straight from head to heels, do one pushup. Remember not to let your back sag or to stick your butt in the air."
  "\n5.Do a frog kick by jumping your feet back to their starting position."
  "\n6.Stand and reach your arms over your head."
  "\n7.Jump quickly into the air so you land back where you started."
  "\n8.As soon as you land with knees bent, get into a squat position and do another repetition."

      "\nMuscular Endurance Training Drill #7: WeightLifting"
  "\nWhat do you need to start weight training?"
  "\nIf you’ve never lifted weights before, consider starting out with the help of a certified personal trainer. They’ll be able to teach you the proper form for specific exercises and set up a strength training program tailored to your needs."
  "\nMany gyms or fitness centers offer introductory training sessions at little or no cost, or they have trainers available if you have questions. Additionally, there are many personal trainers who train clients online, through video platforms."
  "\nWhile most gyms have a combination of resistance machines and free weights, such as dumbbells and barbells, you can also get a comprehensive weight training workout at home with basic equipment."
  "\nWeight lifting tips for beginners"
  "\n1.Warm up. Some aerobic activity, such as a 5-minute jog or brisk walk, will increase blood flow to your muscles and prime them for a good workout. Skipping rope or doing jumping jacks for a few minutes are also good warmup options."
  "\n2.Start with lighter weights. You want to start with a weight that you can lift 10 to 15 times with proper form. Begin with 1 or 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, and slowly progress to 3 sets or more."
  "\n3.Gradually increase the weight. When you can easily do the recommended number of sets and reps, increase the weight by 5 to 10 percent. Check to make sure this is the right weight for you before doing a full workout."
  "\n4.Rest for at least 60 seconds in between sets. This helps prevent muscle fatigue, especially as you start out."
  "\n5.Limit your workout to no longer than 45 minutes. You can get the workout you need in this time frame. Longer sessions may not lead to better results and may increase your risk of burnout and muscle fatigue."
  "\n6.Gently stretch your muscles after your workout. Stretching can help boost your flexibility, ease muscle tension, and reduce your risk of injury."
  "\n7.Rest a day or two in between workouts. Resting gives your muscles time to recover and replenish energy stores before your next workout."


      "\nMuscular Endurance Training Drill #8: Planking"
       "\nHow to Do a Plank"
  "\nSelect a position where you can extend your whole body length. Using an exercise mat will give you enough padding to be comfortable on all fours. You can choose whether to perform a plank on your palms or your forearms, as shown in the video."
  "\n1.Begin in the plank position, face down with your forearms and toes on the floor. Your elbows are directly under your shoulders and your forearms are facing forward. Your head is relaxed and you should be looking at the floor."
  "\n2.Engage your abdominal muscles, drawing your navel toward your spine. Keep your torso straight and rigid and your body in a straight line from your ears to your toes with no sagging or bending. This is the neutral spine position. Ensure your shoulders are down, not creeping up toward your ears. Your heels should be over the balls of your feet."
  "\n3.Hold this position for 10 seconds. Release to floor."
  "\n4.Over time work up to 30, 45, or 60 seconds."

      "\nMuscular Endurance Training Drill #9: Squats"
      "\nThe Details: How to Do a Squat Correctly Every Time, Step by Step"
      "\nStep 1: Stand straight with feet hip-width apart."
      "\nStand with your feet apart, slightly wider than your hips, and place your hands on your hips."
      "\nStep 2: Tighten your stomach muscles."
      "\nStanding up tall, gently pull your shoulders back, subtly lift your chest. On an exhale, try to pull your navel into your back to engage your deep abdominal muscles, which keep the spine and pelvis stable."
      "\nStep 3: Lower down, as if sitting in an invisible chair."
      "\nBend your knees while keeping your upper body as straight as possible, as if you were lowering yourself onto a seat behind you. It is OK to allow your torso to tilt naturally as you squat, just don't collapse your chest or round your shoulders forward. If you're too erect, your hips cannot release properly and you'll put too much strain on your knees."
      "\nLower yourself as far as you can without leaning your upper body more than a few inches forward. Go as deep as you can comfortably. If you have knee issues, don't go deeper than a 90-degree angle, with your thighs parallel to the floor."
      "\nTip: Don't allow your knees to go too far forward. Also, don't let your knees cave inward. Press them outward (almost as if you were pushing out an invisible resistance band) so they stay aligned with your feet as you squat down."
      "\nStep 4: Straighten your legs to lift back up."
      "\nStraighten your legs, being careful not to lock your knees when you reach a standing position."
      "\nTip: Keep your heels glued to the floor as you squat, and then think about driving them into the ground as you rise up to return to the starting position. This will put even more emphasis on your glutes."
      "\nStep 5: Repeat the movement."
      "\nRepeat for three sets of 10 to 15 reps."
      "\nTip: Stretch your arms out in front of you for added balance during squats."

      "\nMuscular Endurance Training Drill #10: Deadlifts"
  "\nHow to Deadlift with Proper Form: The Definitive Guide"
  "\nHere’s how to Deadlift with proper form:"

  "\n1.Stand with your mid-foot under the barbell."
  "\n2.Bend over and grab the bar with a shoulder-width grip."
  "\n3.Bend your knees until your shins touch the bar."
  "\n4.Lift your chest up and straighten your lower back."
  "\n5.Take a big breath, hold it, and stand up with the weight"
  "\nHold the weight for a second at the top, with locked hips and knees. Then return the weight to the floor by moving your hips back while bending your legs. Rest a second at the bottom and repeat. Do five reps on the StrongLifts 5×5 program."
  "\nYour lower back must stay neutral to avoid injury. Rounding it during heavy Deadlifts is dangerous for your spine. It puts uneven pressure on your spinal discs which can injure them. Always Deadlift with a neutral lower back – maintain the natural inward curve of your lower spine."
  "\nThe fastest way to increase your Deadlift is to improve your form. By pulling more efficiently, you can use more muscles and Deadlift heavier weights. This results in more strength and muscle gains. The best way to improve your form is by practicing Deadlifts with proper form."
