    "Agility Training Drill #1: Lateral Pylometric Jumps"
  "\nHow to Do Lateral Plyometric Jumps"
  "\nOnly perform this exercise after a thorough warm up. You will want to begin with nothing more than a line on the floor until you are comfortable with side-to-side jumping."
  "\n1.With feet no more than hip-width apart, bend your knees to squat straight down. Keep your weight on your heels."
  "\n2.Shift weight from heels to toes as you begin your jump, quickly push upward and sideways toward the other side of the line. Land softly and absorb the shock by squatting deeply. Repeat jumping back and forth over the line while keeping your shoulders and hips square and facing forward. You can vary your landing so that you land and rebound on both feet at once, or land on one foot first and rebound with a short double-step."
  "\n3.Perform for 30- to 60-second intervals. In a workout, rest for 60 to 90 seconds, then repeat for three sets. Or, add them to a circuit training routine."
  "\nAgility Training Drill #2: Forward Running, High-Knee Drills"
  "\nHigh Knees are a cardio-intensive exercise performed at a fast pace. It engages your core, strengthens all the muscles in your legs, gets your heart rate up and improves momentum, coordination and flexibility. Because of the many physical benefits, high-knees are incorporated into a wide variety of workouts. They’re also relatively easy exercises to perform because they can be practiced anywhere — no gym or equipment required."
  "\n1.With feet no more than hip-width apart, bend your knees to squat straight down. Keep your weight on your heels."
  "\n2.Switch to lift your right knee to your chest. Continue the movement, alternating legs and moving at a sprinting or running pace."


  "\nAgility Training Drill #3: Lateral-Running, Side-to-Side Drill"

  "\nThis exercise is ideal for court sports, improving both knee and ankle stability."

  "\nTo do this exercise:"

  "\n1. Keeping a low center of gravity, step side-to-side through the ladder one foot at a time."
  "\n2.Touch in each rung of the ladder with both feet."
  "\n3.Land on the balls of the feet."
  "\n4.Repeat right to left and left to right for a total of three sets."


  "\nAgility Training Drill #4: Dot Drills"

  "\nDot drills develop dynamic leg strength while increasing knee and ankle strength and stability. This is a great drill for any sport that requires quick changes of direction and solid landings (including soccer, basketball, racquetball, and skiing)."

  "\nTo do the dot drill, you will either need to purchase a dot drill mat or place five tape marks on the ground in the same pattern as the five dice."

  "\nThe dot drill involves three exercises:"

  "\n4.Continue for a total of six reps per set."

  "\n5.Complete three sets."

      "\n2.Complete three sets of six reps."

      "\nExercise Three:"

      "\n1.Start with your feet on two dots on one side of the square."

      "\n2.Following one step after the next, move your right foot the center dot, left foot to the forward dot, right foot to the forward dot, left foot the center dot, right foot back to the starting dot, and left foot back to the starting dot."

      "\n3.Continue, picking up speed, for a total of six reps."

      "\n4.Complete three sets."

      "\n5.Complete three sets."


      "\nAgility Training Drill #6: L Drill"

      "\nSet Up: L shaped with 5 yards between each cone. Similar to a box, without the fourth corner"

      "\nDescription: The L drill, also known as the 3 Cone, is another popular change-of-direction drill especially used by football coaches and scouts to measure agility."

      "\nPattern: Starting at the line, use a 3-point stance and come out low for five yards under control. Touch the line at the center cone."

      "\nThen return to the start and touch the line using the same hand. Turn and sprint back around the center cone, planting off your inside foot for a hard turn and figure 8 around the end cone, again planting with your inside foot"

      "\nMake a sharp cut around the middle cone with your inside foot and sprint back towards the first cone, finishing the drill. Repeat this pattern going the other direction, always doing the same amount both to the right and the left."
