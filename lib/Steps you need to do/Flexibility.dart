      "Flexibility Training Drill #1: Standing Quad Stretch"
      "\nStretching the quadriceps muscles improves flexibility for this large muscle found in the front of thigh. This stretch is a common one used as part of a warmup or after-exercise stretching, especially for activities such as cycling, running, and yoga. There are many different ways to stretch your quadriceps, but this is a simple version you can do while standing."
      "\nStep-by-Step Instructions"
      "\n1.Stand on one leg. If you need support, hold onto something solid, such as a wall or chair, for support."
      "\n2.Bend your right knee and bring your heel toward your buttock."
     "\n3.Reach for your ankle with your opposite (left) hand."
  "\n4.Stand up straight and pull in your abdominal muscles. Try to keep your knees next to each other. Relax your shoulders. As you hold your leg in the bent position you will feel a slight pull along the front of your thigh and hip."
  "\n5.Breathe deeply and hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, release and repeat on the left leg, this time holding your ankle with your right hand. Stretch each leg one to five times in a stretching session."

      "\nFlexibility Training Drill #2: Standing Side Stretch"
  "\nStanding Side Bend is a basic standing pose that stretches the spine and obliques and promotes better posture. This pose also strengthens the legs. If you are looking to stand taller and look leaner you should learn how to do Standing Side Bend."
  "\nHere are the steps to learn Standing Side Bend:"
  "\n1) Stand tall with feet and legs together and reach both arms straight up overhead as you inhale."
  "\n2) Lower your right arm down the right side of your body and exhale as you lengthen the left arm over the head, bending body gently to the right."
  "\n3) Inhale to return arms overhead to center and exhale as you repeat on the left side."

      "\nFlexibility Training Drill #3:  Seated Hamstring Stretch"
  "\nStretching while in a seated position is less gentle than lying on the back. While using a sitting position, the degree of stretch must be adjusted based on the pain level. An important part of this technique is to avoid rounding the lower back; instead, fold forward at the hip."
  "\nTo stretch the hamstrings while sitting, follow these steps:"
  "\n1.Sit on the edge of a chair, straighten one leg in front of the body with the heel on the floor."
  "\n2.Straighten the spine by sitting tall and rolling the pelvis forward."
  "\n3.Hold this stretch for 30 seconds."

      "\nFlexibility Training Drill #4:  Standing Calf Stretch"
  "\nThis exercise stretches the muscles at the back of the lower leg (the calf) and the Achilles tendon. Do this exercise 3 or 4 times a day, 5 days a week."
  "\nTo do this stretch:"
  "\n1.Stand facing a wall with your hands on the wall at about eye level. Put the leg you want to stretch about a step behind your other leg."
  "\n2.Keeping your back heel on the floor, bend your front knee until you feel a stretch in the back leg."
  "\n3.Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times."
  "\nRepeat the exercise with the back knee bent a little, still keeping your back heel on the floor. This will stretch a different part of the calf muscles."

      "\nFlexibility Training Drill #5: Shoulder Stretch"
  "\n1.Relax your shoulders."
  "\n2.Raise one arm to shoulder height, and reach it across your chest."
  "\n3.Pull the arm slightly toward you with your other arm. This will help you get a gentle stretch. Hold for about 6 seconds."
  "\n4.Repeat 2 to 4 times."

      "\nFlexibility Training Drill #6:  The Forward Hang"
  "\nThis stretch is amazing if you’re working at a desk all day. It only takes 2 minutes and it will leave you feeling surprisingly refreshed. To understand why, let's look at what the forward fold looks like and what muscles it stretches."
  "\1.Place your feet apart. Stand tall and roll your shoulders back. Inhale and let your arms hang loose. As you exhale, bend forward and bend your knees enough to bring your palms flat to the floor and your head pressed against your knees."
  "\n2.Feel your spine stretching as you pull your head down. Try to straighten your legs to deepen the stretch."
  "\n3.Breathe and hold for 4-8 breaths."
  "\n4.When you are ready, bend your knees again and return to your initial position."
  "\nThis stretch activates your abdominal, quads and calves.  It stretches your hip muscles, hamstrings and lower back. These same muscles often feel tight and sore after several hours spent sitting at a desk."

  "\nThe forward fold stretch also stimulates digestive, urogenital, nervous and endocrine systems."
      "\nFlexibility Training Drill #7: Knees-to-chest Back Stretch"
  "\nTo perform the knees-to-chest back stretch:"
  "\n1.Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor."
  "\n2.Place your hands on the back of your thighs or below your knees and pull your legs toward your chest."
  "\n3.Pull until you feel a gentle stretch."
  "\n4.Hold for 15 seconds."
  "\n5.Return to the starting position."
  "\n6.Repeat 9 more times."

  "\nFlexibility Training Drill #8: Butterfly Groin Stretch"

  "\n The butterfly stretch is a seated groin and inner thigh stretch that targets those areas. It is a great stretch for athletes who play field or court sports, runners, and anyone who has tight hips or a history of groin injuries."
  "\nIt is also a preparatory stretch to get you flexible enough to do splits. You can do this stretch after a lower body workout or an activity such as running."
  "\nStep-by-Step Instructions"
  "\n1.Sit down on the floor or ground with your legs in front of you."
  "\n2.Reach forward and grab your right foot. It is OK to bend your knee to help your hand and foot connect. Gently pull your right foot up towards your groin bending until it is at a comfortable spot and the sole of the foot is facing your left thigh."
  "\n3.Bend your left knee to bring your left foot toward your groin so that its sole touches the sole of your right foot."
  "\n4.Hold your feet with your hands and rest your elbows on your knees."
  "\n5.While keeping your back straight (no slouching), allow your knees to fall towards the ground. You can apply gentle pressure on the inner thigh by pressing gently on the knees with the elbows. You should feel gentle pulling and tension in the groin."
  "\n6.Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds."
  "\n7.Release and repeat three times."

      "\nFlexibility Training Drill #9: Split Squat"
  "\nWhen doing split squats, keep your feet hip-width apart, roll your shoulders back and tighten your abs. Breathe in as you lunge, and put your weight in the front heel. Keep the movement smooth and continuous and exhale as you push yourself back up."
  "\nSplit Squat Instructions"
  "\n1. Start in a split leg position, with one leg forward and one leg back."
  "\n2. Flex your knees and lower your hips, until the back knee is just above the floor."
  "\n3. Stand back up and return to the starting position."
  "\n4. Repeat this movement for as many reps as recommended and then switch legs."

  "\nFlexibility Training Drill #10: Mortified Cobra"
  "\nHow to Do Cobra Pose"
  "\nIt is important to practice cobra in correct alignment to avoid unnecessary stress on your back, neck, or shoulders. Additionally, experts recommend that beginners learn this pose under the guidance of a certified yoga instructor. Here is a step-by-step guide that will help you practice this pose with mindfulness and focus on body alignment:"
  "\n1. Lie down in a prone position. Lie face down on your mat with your entire body extended. Press your legs and the tops of your feet firmly into the yoga mat and bring your legs to a hips-width distance."
  "\n2. Bring your hands underneath the shoulder blades. Bring your hands palms facing down directly underneath your shoulder blades and prepare to lift your upper body and head."
  "\n3. Begin to lift your upper body. Press through the hands to lift the upper body and first come into a low cobra. Ensure that you are not pressing too much weight in the hands because you want to focus on strengthening the lower back muscles to lift gently."
  "\n4. Use lower back muscles to lift higher. When you feel stabilized in low cobra, begin to press gently into the hands, even more, using your back and abdominal muscles to lift as high as you comfortably can into a deeper backend. Continue breathing comfortably in and out through the nose. Keep your shoulder blades back and down as you draw your chest forward. You do not have to remain completely static in this posture—you can undulate and writhe like a serpent."
  "\n5. Look slightly forward and up. Keep your gaze neutral but slightly facing up. Ensure the back of your neck is long to ensure proper spinal alignment. You can stay here for a few breaths, maintaining spinal alignment and integrity in the breath."
  "\n6. Lower down gently. On an exhale, slowly lower down to the ground."
  "\n7. Transition to the next posture. Two common postures to transition into after cobra are pushing up and back into Balasana (child’s pose) or Adho Mukha Svanasana (downward-facing dog)."
  "\nHow to Modify Cobra Pose"
  "\nIf cobra pose is too intense or you want to start slower, you can try baby cobra, a modified version that requires less backend."
  "\nTo do baby cobra, follow all of the steps for cobra pose, except avoid putting any weight on your hands, keep your gaze down and your neck long, and only lift halfway up. This modification is suitable for people who have back pain or want to work up to full cobra pose. It is also a great modification if you are engaging in a more restorative yoga practice."
